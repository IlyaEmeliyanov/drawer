Web app for drawing stuff on a browser canvas.

# ⚒️ Instruction
This app is currently built on plain **VanillaJS** and for using all the **npm** packages you need to compile the ***index.html*** using a web app bundler.
One simple solution that I suggest is ***parcel.js***. It's easy to use, it's lightweight and you don't need to add a lot of configurations.
